    <h1>Nova Celeste Alario</h1>
    <p>Nova is a woman with a <strong>strong</strong> personality and sense of self. She recognizes her limits and does her best to play to her strengths. While she remains relatively down to earth, family and friends tend to look up to her for their inspiration.</p>

<div id = "Family">
    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>Nova is an only child of hippie parents. She was born in San Fransisco and lived near the corner of Haight and Ashbury, the center of the Hippie movement. Nova's mother, Miriam, had friends that were naming their children Star, Rainbow, or Leaf, but she wanted something different for her baby. The week she found out she was pregnant, a satellite that Miriam's father co-designed spotted an exploding star, a nova, in space. This, she thought was just what she was looking for.</p>

        <img src="./Pics/Miriam.jpg" height=100 alt="Miriam with her father, Joe">
        <p>Miriam was born in New York but moved to California in the early '60's when her father took a job with TRW, a prominent aerospace company at the time. </p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Daughter">
        <img src="./Pics/Ivory.jpg" height=150 alt="Ivory">
        <p>Ivory is saccharine sweet, adorable, smart, and worst of all, absolutely knows it. She is only 5, but has most of the world figured out. Or at least she thinks she does. </p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Husband">
        <img src="./Pics/Us.jpg" height=100 alt="Josh and Nova">
        <p>Josh is a man with no equal. Nova met him on what was supposed to be a "<em>don't care anymore</em>" weekend. He is a confidant, a friend, a partner, and her biggest supporter.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Kids">
        <img src="./Pics/Kids.jpg" height=100 alt="Drew and Maddie with Josh">
        <p>Maddie and Drew are Josh's kids from a previous marriage. They spend the weekend with Josh and Nova every other week. This is when they get the most use out of memberships to <a href="https://www.springspreserve.org"> Springs Preserve</a> and <a href="https://www.discoverykidslv.org">Discovery Museum</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Pet">

        <p>Pixel is a Calico cat named for the cat in one of Nova's favorite book series.</p>

<div id = "Friends">
    <h2>Friends</h2>
    <p>In order of how long they have known Nova:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#JG">JG</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Kim">Kim</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Dayana">Dayana</a></li>

    </ol>
    <div id = "JG">
        <img src="./Pics/JG.jpg" height=150 alt="JG and Nova">
        <p>JG and Nova have been friends since high school. Through loves and losses they have been best friends. Technically, we can blame JG for introducing her to Josh.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Kim">
        <img src="./Pics/Kim.jpg" height=100 alt="Kim and Nova">
        <p>Kim is still considered Nova's best friend, even though they never get to see each other after Nova moved away. She probably knows Nova better than anyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Dayana">
        <img src="./Pics/Dayana.jpg" height=100 alt="Josh, Nova, and Dayana">
        <p>Dayana was just a work friend to start, but quickly became more. Despite her younger age, she and Nova bonded and became fast friends. She, alone, knows the secret.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Locals">
        <img src="./Pics/Bussen.jpg" height=100 alt="Bowling Night">
        <img src="./Pics/Pirates.jpg" height=100 alt="At the Bar">
        <p>Since moving to Las Vegas in September 2017, Nova has acquired some fun and odd friends. She has more friends than ever before and loves each and every one of them. <strong>Goofballs!</strong></p>
